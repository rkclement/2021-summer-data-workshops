## Expectations for working together in Zoom

* Take some time to set up your screen
  * RStudio, Zoom window, Zoom chat, maybe a web browser
* Leave your camera on if you are comfortable
* Feel free to ask questions by:
  * Unmuting, raising hand, putting question in chat...
* Don't hesitate to ask questions!

## Asking questions, giving feedback{.vcenter .flexbox}

![](slides/zoom_reactions.png)

## Plan for today

1. What is R and why should you learn it?
2. Finding your way around R/RStudio
3. Introduction to R
4. Break
5. Getting started with data

## Why R?

* text based (that's a good thing!)
* code is great for reproducibility
* interdisciplinary and extensible
* works on data of all shapes and sizes
* produces high-quality graphics
* large and welcoming community
* free, open-source, and cross-platform

## Wait, but I've never programmed before!

* R is a statistical programming language
* learning a programming language is much like learning any language
* we're going to take our time, don't be afraid to ask questions or ask Ryan to slow down
* once you are used to it, you can do things much more quickly
  * and, importantly, more reproducibly!

## R + RStudio{.smaller}

## Setting your working directory + RStudio projects{.flexbox .vcenter}

![](slides/find-file-tree.svg)

## Organizing your project

```{r directories, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
dir.create("data")
dir.create("data_output")
dir.create("fig_output")
```

### Downloading the data

```{r downloading, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/11492171",
              "data/SAFI_clean.csv", mode = "wb")
```

## Installing new packages

* using the pacakges tab in RStudio
* using the `install.packages()` function

## Exercise #1

Using all you've learned so far, make sure that you have the `tidyverse` package installed, and then install two more packages: `here` and `lubridate`


When you're done, please give a :thumbs-up: or a :green-check: in the Zoom reactions.


## Exercise #2

What do you think is the current content of the object `area_acres`? 

123.5 or 6.175?

## Exercise #3

Create two variables `r_length` and `r_width` and assign them values. It should be noted that, because `length` is a built-in R function, R Studio might add “()” after you type `length` and if you leave the parentheses you will get unexpected results. This is why you might see other programmers abbreviate common words. Create a third variable `r_area` and give it a value based on the current values of `r_length` and `r_width`. Show that changing the values of either `r_length` and `r_width` does not affect the value of `r_area`.

When you're done, please give a :thumbs-up: or a :green-check: in the Zoom reactions.


## Exercise #4

Type in `?round` at the console and then look at the output in the Help pane. What other functions exist that are similar to `round`? How do you use the `digits` parameter in the round function?

When you're done, please give a :thumbs-up: or a :green-check: in the Zoom reactions.

## Exercise #5

We’ve seen that atomic vectors can be of type character, numeric (or double), integer, and logical. But what happens if we try to mix these types in a single vector?

What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()` to check the data type of your objects):

```{r atomic-vectors-q, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
 num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
 num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
 char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
 tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
```

Why do you think this happens?

When you're done, please give a :thumbs-up: or a :green-check: in the Zoom reactions.

## Exercise #6

You’ve probably noticed that objects of different types get converted into a single, shared type within a vector. In R, we call converting objects from one class into another class *coercion*. These conversions happen according to a hierarchy, whereby some types get preferentially coerced into other types. Can you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of how these data types are coerced?

When you're done, please give a :thumbs-up: or a :green-check: in the Zoom reactions.


## Coercion hierarchy{.flexbox .vcenter}

logical < integer < numeric < character


## Exercise #7

Using this vector of rooms, create a new vector with the NAs removed.

```{r ex7, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
rooms <- c(1, 2, 1, 1, NA, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 8, 3, 1, NA, 1)
```

When you're done, please give a :thumbs-up: or a :green-check: in the Zoom reactions.

## Exercise #7a

Use the function `median()` to calculate the median of the rooms vector.

## What are data frames and tibbles?{.flexbox .vcenter .smaller}

![](slides/data-frame.svg)

A data frame can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by the functions `read_csv()` or `read_table()`; in other words, when importing spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web). We will now demonstrate how to import tabular data using `read_csv()`.

## Inspecting a data frame or tibble{.smaller}

* Size:
  * `dim(interviews)` - returns a vector with (rows, columns)
  * `nrow(interviews)` - returns the number of rows
  * `ncol(interviews)` - returns the number of columns

* Content:
  * `head(interviews)` - shows the first 6 rows
  * `tail(interviews)` - shows the last 6 rows

* Names:
  * `names(interviews)` - returns the column names 

* Summary:
  * `str(interviews)` - structure + information about the class, length, and content of each column
  * `summary(interviews)` - summary statistics for each column
  * `glimpse(interviews)` - returns dimensions of the tibble, name/class and preview of each column 
  
Note: most of these functions are “generic.” They can be used on other types of objects besides data frames or tibbles.

## Exercise #8{.smaller}

1. Create a tibble (`interviews_100`) containing only the data in row 100 of the `interviews` dataset.

2. Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in the tibble? Use that number to pull out just that last row in the tibble. Create a new tibble (`interviews_last`) using the `nrow()` instead of the row number. Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make sure it’s meeting expectations.

3. Using the number of rows in the interviews dataset that you found in question 2, extract the row that is in the middle of the dataset. Store the content of this middle row in an object named `interviews_middle`. (**hint**: This dataset has an odd number of rows, so finding the middle is a bit trickier than dividing `n_rows` by 2. Use the `median( )` function and what you’ve learned about sequences in R to extract the middle row!

4. Combine `nrow()` with the `-` notation above to reproduce the behavior of `head(interviews)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the `interviews` dataset.

When you're done, please give a :thumbs-up: or a :green-check: in the Zoom reactions.

## Factors

R has a special data class, called factor, to deal with categorical data that you may encounter when creating plots or doing statistical analyses. Factors are very useful and actually contribute to making R particularly well suited to working with data. So we are going to spend a little time introducing them.

Factors represent categorical data. They are stored as integers associated with labels and they can be ordered (ordinal) or unordered (nominal). Factors create a structured relation between the different levels (values) of a categorical variable, such as days of the week or responses to a question in a survey. This can make it easier to see how one element relates to the other elements in a column. While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually treated as integer vectors by `R`. So you need to be very careful when treating them as strings.

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, known as levels. By default, R always sorts levels in alphabetical order. 

## Exercise #9

* Rename the levels of the factor to have the first letter in uppercase: “No”,”Undetermined”, and “Yes”.
* Now that we have renamed the factor level to “Undetermined”, can you recreate the barplot such that “Undetermined” is last (after “Yes”)?

When you're done, please give a :thumbs-up: or a :green-check: in the Zoom reactions.

## Formatting dates

One of the most common issues that new (and experienced!) `R`users have is converting date and time information into a variable that is appropriate and usable during analyses. As a reminder, the best practice for dealing with date data is to ensure that each component of your date is stored as a separate variable. In our dataset, we have a column `interview_date` which contains information about the year, month, and day that the interview was conducted. Let’s convert those dates into three separate columns.

We are going to use the package `lubridate`, which is included in the `tidyverse` installation but not loaded by default, so we have to load it explicitly with `library(lubridate)`.
