## Expectations for working together in Zoom

* Take some time to set up your screen
  * RStudio, Zoom window, Zoom chat, maybe a web browser
* Leave your camera on if you are comfortable
* Feel free to ask questions by:
  * Unmuting, raising hand, putting question in chat...
* Don't hesitate to ask questions!

## Asking questions, giving feedback{.vcenter .flexbox}

## Plan for today

1. The Grammar of Graphics
2. `ggplot2` basics
3. Building plots iteratively 
4. Adding labels and titles
5. Theming
6. Saving your output

NOTE: We'll have a break about halfway through!

## Getting the data loaded

```{r message=FALSE, echo = TRUE}

# if attended last week and properly saved the data
interviews_plotting <- read_csv("data_output/interviews_plotting.csv")

# if you didn't attend last week and/or don't have the data
# interviews_plotting <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rkclement/2021-summer-data-workshops/main/data_output/interviews_plotting.csv")
```


## The Grammar of Graphics

> "The layered grammar of graphics approach is implemented in ggplot2, a widely used graphics library for R. All graphics in this library are built using a layered approach, building layers up to create the final graphic."
>
> `r tufte::quote_footer('--- [Benjamin Soltoff, "Computing for the Social Sciences," University of Chicago](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/notes/grammar-of-graphics/)')`

\b>

> "A grammar may ... help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics. This is easy to see by analogy to the English language: good grammar is just the first step in creating a good sentence."

## Components of a `ggplot2` graphic

* Layer
    * Data
    * Mapping
    * Statistical transformation (stat)
    * Geometric object (geom)
    * Position adjustment (position)
* Scale
* Coordinate system (coord)
* Faceting (facet)
* Themes

## Most basic components of a `ggplot2` graphic

* Data
* Aesthetic mapping (`aes`)
    * Describes how variables are mapped onto graphical attributes
    * Visual attribute of data including x-y axes, `color`, `fill`, `shape`, and `alpha`
* Geometric objects (`geom`)
    * Determines how values are rendered graphically, as bars (`geom_bar`), scatterplot (`geom_point`), line (`geom_line`), etc.

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
<DATA> %>%
    ggplot(aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +
    <GEOM_FUNCTION>()
```


## Correctly using the `+` for adding layers

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
## This is the correct syntax for adding layers
interviews_plot +
    geom_point()

## This will not add the new layer and will return an error message
interviews_plot
+ geom_point()
```

## Exercise #1 

Use what you just learned to create a scatter plot of `rooms` by `village` with the `respondent_wall_type` showing in different colors. Does this seem like a good way to display the relationship between these variables? What other kinds of plots might you use to show this type of data?

When you're done, please give a `:thumbs-up:` or a `:green-check:` in the Zoom reactions.

## Boxplots

```{r echo = FALSE}
interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = respondent_wall_type, y = rooms)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

## Exercise #2

Boxplots are useful summaries, but hide the shape of the distribution. For example, if the distribution is bimodal, we would not see it in a boxplot. An alternative to the boxplot is the violin plot, where the shape (of the density of points) is drawn.

* Replace the box plot with a violin plot; see `geom_violin()`.

When you're done, please give a `:thumbs-up:` or a `:green-check:` in the Zoom reactions.

## Exercise #3

So far, we’ve looked at the distribution of room number within wall type. Try making a new plot to explore the distribution of another variable within wall type.

* Create a boxplot for `liv_count` for each wall type. Overlay the boxplot layer on a jitter layer to show actual measurements.

When you're done, please give a `:thumbs-up:` or a `:green-check:` in the Zoom reactions.

## Exercise #4

Add colour to the data points on your boxplot according to whether the respondent is a member of an irrigation association (`memb_assoc`).

When you're done, please give a `:thumbs-up:` or a `:green-check:` in the Zoom reactions.

## Barplots

```{r echo = FALSE}
interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = respondent_wall_type)) +
    geom_bar()
```

## Exercise #5

Create a bar plot showing the proportion of respondents in each village who are or are not part of an irrigation association (`memb_assoc`). Include only respondents who answered that question in the calculations and plot. Which village had the lowest proportion of respondents in an irrigation association?

## Labels and titles

The `labs` function takes the following arguments:

* `title` – to produce a plot title
* `subtitle` – to produce a plot subtitle (smaller text placed beneath the title)
* `caption` – a caption for the plot
* `...` – any pair of name and value for aesthetics used in the plot (e.g., `x`, `y`, `fill`, `color`, `size`)

## Faceting

```{r echo = FALSE}
percent_wall_type <- interviews_plotting %>%
    filter(respondent_wall_type != "cement") %>%
    count(village, respondent_wall_type) %>%
    group_by(village) %>%
    mutate(percent = (n / sum(n)) * 100) %>%
    ungroup()
```


```{r echo = FALSE}
percent_wall_type %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = respondent_wall_type, y = percent)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    labs(title="Proportion of wall type by village",
         x="Wall Type",
         y="Percent") +
    facet_wrap(~ village)
```

## `ggplot2` themes

In addition to `theme_bw`(), which changes the plot background to white, `ggplot2` comes with several other themes which can be useful to quickly change the look of your visualization. The complete list of themes is available at [https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html). `theme_minimal`() and `theme_light`() are popular, and `theme_void`() can be useful as a starting point to create a new hand-crafted theme.

The [`ggthemes`](https://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes/reference/index.html) package provides a wide variety of options (including an Excel 2003 theme). The `ggplot2` [extensions website](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) provides a list of packages that extend the capabilities of `ggplot2`, including additional themes.

* Experiment with at least two different themes. Build the previous plot using each of those themes. Which do you like best?

## Exercise 6

With all of this information in hand, please take another five minutes to either improve one of the plots generated in this exercise or create a beautiful graph of your own. Use the RStudio `ggplot2` [cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf) for inspiration. Here are some ideas:

* See if you can make the bars white with black outline.
* Try using a different colour palette (see [http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/)).

## Saving your output

After creating your plot, you can save it to a file in your favorite format. The *Export* tab in the *Plot* pane in RStudio will save your plots at low resolution, which will not be accepted by many journals and will not scale well for posters.

Instead, use the `ggsave`() function, which allows you easily change the dimension and resolution of your plot by adjusting the appropriate arguments (`width`, `height`, and `dpi`).

Make sure you have the `fig_output/` folder in your working directory.
